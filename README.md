Home Page consists of basic navigation menu, search bar to search for products and link to sign up/login pages. Main page consists of many carousels that lead to different sections of app. I also have a footer. This app is fully responsive. It is compatible with different device sizes.

# Search functionality:
I can search for a particular product with search bar. I will get all products related to our search.



# Signup/Signin Pages:
This is the signup page, which the user will get if he clicks on the continue button on the account page and new users can create an account here.
This is a multi-user application. I can signup or login using my credentials. I used jwt for authentication.  I used OAuth to implement this.

I have Products page, where I have all products of different categories. I can also filter products based on category, brand and department. I also have different sorting options.



# Cart Page:
I can add products to cart. I can also apply coupon discounts. I can increase and decrease the quantity of products and also remove products from cart. On clicking checkout, user will be redirected to payments page.




# Checkout Page:

User can enter payment details in payment page. On clicking pay now, they will be redirected to Home Page. User's cart will be empty. User can also logout of their account.
